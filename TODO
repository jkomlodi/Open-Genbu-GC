FIRMWARE

- Add priority queue system
    - ISR handlers will add events to the queue, which the main control loop
      will execute.
      For now these will probably just be a uint32_t handled by a switch
    - If nothing left to execute, main loop DSBs and WFIs.

- Wire up buttons to GPIOs on pico

- Add IRQ handlers for buttons
    - When IRQ is fired, handler should add an event to the highest priority
      queue.
      The main control loop then processes this queue.

- Investigate debounce
    - Either needs to be done in firmware, or microswitch has internal
      debouncing.  Probably the former.
    - For firmware debounce, latch on first high pulse and only send the press
      if we latched on this IRQ trigger.
        * Have an RTC/timer fire after  10ms or so to unlatch.

- Light up buttons
    - Might just be a LEDs that can be driven directly

- Ring LED
    - Determine current draw, see if we can run at half brightness and be okay
    - If draw is too high, need to investigate using a FET that enables barrel
      jack power.
    - Use PIO to control the LEDs, they look like WS2812s
    - Add functions that the user can decide at compile-time to use for LED
      pattern.

- Pretty-fy files
    - Some of the USB stuff could be improved on a bit, and deviated from what
      the Pi Foundation wrote.

- Ease of use firmware downloading/upgrading
    - Not everyone has a Pi to bitbang SWD to download firmware, the Pico has
      a way to drag and drop firmware to upgrade it, investigate that.

- Use USB CDC for LED configuration
    - Depends if Switch is okay with composite devices
    - Also needs some sort of protocol to parse user input for how LEDs are
      handled
    - Might be abandoned unless I have free time
